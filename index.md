Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/). I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from [Columbia University](https://polisci.columbia.edu/) in 2018. My research interests include comparative political behavior, distributive politics, causal inference, and Latin American politics. My research specifically focuses on how voters modify their political preferences and electoral choices after negative events such as natural disasters, crime, and economic shocks. 

My research has been published, or is forthcoming, in the *British Journal of Political Science*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, and *Electoral Studies*, among others.
