Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [Purdue University](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/).
Starting in Fall 2022, I will be an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [Penn State](https://polisci.la.psu.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from [Columbia University](https://polisci.columbia.edu/) in 2018. I grew up in the [south of Chile](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/chile/the-lakes-district/puerto-varas) and completed by undergraduate degree at [Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](http://www.cienciapolitica.uc.cl/).

I study comparative political behavior and the political economy of developing countries, with a regional focus on Latin America. My work relies on a variety of methods for drawing causal inferences from experimental and observational data. 

My research has been published, or is forthcoming, in the *British Journal of Political Science*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, *Public Opinion Quarterly*, and *Electoral Studies*, among other outlets.

You can reach me (in English or Spanish) at: gviscont[AT]purdue[DOT]edu.
